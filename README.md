ðŸŽ§ Video Transcription Tool

I found myself wondering what to code next â€” then it hit me. Last week, I built a simple program that generates transcriptions from audio files. I figured, why not improve it and share it with everyone?

This repo is the result: a lightweight, handy transcription tool thatâ€™s easy to use and open for improvements. If you find it helpful or have ideas to make it even better, feel free to contribute â€” together, we can turn it into something truly powerful!

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s build this tool into something awesome!
